#LoanPro PHP SDK

The purpose of this sdk is to make it easier for developers using PHP to integrate with the LoanPro REST API. 

The current release supports token authorization and HTTP request handling and OData request filtering. Tutorials can be found at https://help-loanpro.simnang.com/knowledge-base/getting-started-with-the-php-sdk/.

The roadmap for the SDK includes the following:
- Creating objects that correspond with all LoanPro entities
- Create procedures to abstract complicated operations in the API
 
Pre-release versions will have items in the roadmap which are not yet ready for production. Pre-release versions are not yet ready for production and are not recommended for use in 3rd party systems.
